## üß™ Troubleshooting & FAQ  

**Q: The script didn‚Äôt run with administrator rights?**  
A: For the tool to work properly, administrator rights are required.  
Right-click the `.bat` file and choose "Run as administrator".  

If nothing happens, check that UAC is enabled and try again.  

Run manually with PowerShell if needed:  
```powershell
Start-Process powershell -Verb RunAs -ArgumentList "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File 'Path\To\Windows_Maintenance_Tool.ps1'"
```  

**Q: Why does it crash when selecting registry cleanup?**  
A: This was fixed in v5.0.0. The tool now safely lists and deletes registry keys with auto-backup.  

**Q: Why was Registry Defrag removed?**  
A: It depended on NTREGOPT, which is no longer accessible. The script is now fully offline and native to Windows.
